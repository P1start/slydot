Slydot: The Sunrise Event
=========================

A clone of Spybot: The Nightfall Incident, written in Rust.

Obviously, the name is not final.

Progress
--------

### Implemented

- Basic rendering
- Keyboard controls
- Movement
- Simple enemy-targetting attacks
- Self-targetting attacks
- Loading levels from files

### Coming soon (hopefully)

- Mouse controls
- AI players
- Floor-targetting attacks

### Longer-term goals

- GUI
- Animations
  - For example: losing cells on a unit makes those tiles sink into the ground
- Story mode
- Actual units and attacks (with names and everything)
  - Unit customisation?
- Multiplayer

### Other ideas (may not be realised)

- Fog-of-war levels (every level?) where the terrain & enemies are not visible
  unless they are in sight
